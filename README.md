# A tutorial to getting OpenFISCA working on Windows.

Good morning.

This is a guide for getting OpenFISCA working on a Windows machine, written specifically from a non-tech, policymaker background.

This guide is specific to the OpenFISCA NSW implementation (but most of the principles should work for other jurisdictions, too.)

And more specifically this is written for DPIE SPB, who are going to be implementing Rules as Code for the ESS, using OpenFISCA.

(Forking of this tutorial for other jurisdictions is welcome.)

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have:
- some knowledge of coding, specifically Python, but probably not an expert
- knowledge of the specific legislation/ruleset you're looking to code
- a Windows machine with Windows 10 Professional

This guides assumes you do not have:
- knowledge of what Docker does
- a MacOS machine
- strong coding skills
